I run **Constringo**, a one-man business providing hosting and related technical services. I build things that are fast and reliable, not flashy and slow.

- **Networking**  
  Elaborate work with network stacks, protocols, and infrastructure.

- **Rust (general)**  
  Writing efficient software, from browsers to bare metal, always with a focus on reliability and performance.

- **Vulkan Rendering & Other**  
  Implementing rendering pipelines and low-level graphics code.

- **Systems Programming**  
  Working close to the hardware: operating systems, memory, concurrency, threading, and tooling.

- **Web Hosting**
- **Web Development & Design**  
  Designing and building websites, managing databases, all with user experience in mind.

- **Scripting**  
  Selenium, Bash, etc. Anything that automates tasks.
